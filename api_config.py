Please analyze the following prediction regarding a student's {language} code submission to a problem assigned by their instructor.

The predicted primary verdict for this submission is: "{predicted_verdict_string}".

The model has also provided the following probability distribution across all possible verdicts:
{verdict_probabilities_str}

Based on this analysis, provide a brief and informative review (2â€“3 sentences) for the instructor. Your response should:
- Acknowledge success if the predicted verdict is "Accepted" and optionally highlight the strong scores.
- If the verdict indicates a failure (e.g., "Wrong Answer", "Compile Error", "Runtime Error"), identify the general area of concern and suggest likely causes or next steps the student could take.
- If the verdict is "Time Limit Exceeded" or "Memory Limit Exceeded", comment on possible inefficiencies or excessive resource usage in the implementation.
- If the verdict is "Presentation Error", recommend checking formatting or output conventions.

The tone should remain professional, objective, and constructive, providing insight that may assist the instructor in understanding the submission quality.
