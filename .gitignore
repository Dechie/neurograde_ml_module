# Project CodeNet Dataset (VERY IMPORTANT - This is likely huge)

# relative to your .gitignore file's location (usually the project root)
# Adjust the path if necessary.

# If your "data/final_problem_statements.csv" is an INPUT and should be tracked,
# you might want to be more specific with the generated files above or use a pattern
# like 'data/submissions_*.csv' and 'data/submission_stats_*.csv'
# However, if "data/" is purely for generated output, you could even do:
# data/
