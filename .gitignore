# Project CodeNet Dataset (VERY IMPORTANT - This is likely huge)
# Assuming your Project_CodeNet directory is at ../Project_CodeNet/
# relative to your .gitignore file's location (usually the project root)
# Adjust the path if necessary.
../Project_CodeNet/data/

# Or, if Project_CodeNet is directly inside your project root:

# CSV files
*.csv

# If your "data/final_problem_statements.csv" is an INPUT and should be tracked,
# you might want to be more specific with the generated files above or use a pattern
# like 'data/submissions_*.csv' and 'data/submission_stats_*.csv'
# However, if "data/" is purely for generated output, you could even do:
# data/

# Extracted language submissions (if you used the extraction script)
# (Assuming it created 'extracted_language_submissions/' in your project root)
